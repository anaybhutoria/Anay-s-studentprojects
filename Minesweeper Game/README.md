### Running Minesweeper
In GitHub please open the folder Minesweeper Game in order to find the final iteration of the game. In addition to the application and the view packages the program contains the previous packages from the first iteration. In order to run the program in eclipse, first clone the repository from the desktop app so that it contains the latest version of the repository. In eclipse create a JAVA project and import the files retrived from the GitHub into the src folder. In the application package run the GameApp.java in order to run the game.
